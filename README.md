# Face-Mask-Detector

**Introduction**
The situation around us today requires us to stay safe at all times. An important step to prevent contracting the corona virus is to wear masks everytime we are in public.
This project is built using python and machine learning concepts to detect if a person is wearing a mask or not in real time.
The dataset has about 300 training images each for two classes - Mask and No Mask. Further more images have been used for testing and validation.

**Tools used**
Python 3
Jupyter Notebook

**Description**

1.Import the dataset folder.

2.Load the Model.ipynb file and run it.

3.Run the Final.ipynb file.

**Conclusion**

You can also use an external webcam for detection.
This project can be implemented on a larger scale at public places to detect people not wearing masks. This will although require more dataset and training for extremely accurate predictions.
Various other features like predicting if social distancing is followed or not can also  be added.
